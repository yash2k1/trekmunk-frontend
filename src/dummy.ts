      "I had an amazing trek with Trekmunk to Sandakphu November and December 2019. From the first moment of inquiry about the trek and all my questions were answered clearly and on time thanks to Dheeraj who managed to facilitate the trek quite well with his communication. Our guide Arpan was very experienced, calm, patient and very helpful to each trekker's needs in the group. He facilitated to find and hire a porter for me once I needed one although we were in the middle of the trail. He also arranged emergency transportation when I had to cut the trek and go back home for an urgent matter. I really enjoyed their service and I would like to repeat the same trek or try other treks with them again.",
